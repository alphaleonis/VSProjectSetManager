# Visual Studio Project Set Manager

The Visual Studio Project Set Manager extension allows saving and restoring which projects are currently loaded in the solution in named profiles. 

This makes it easier to work with very large solutions where you frequently find yourself unloading and loading different sets of projects to 
speed build and load times based on what you are currently working on.

Extension is available at [Visual Studio Marketplace (VS2022)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterPalotas.AlphaleonisProjectSetManager22) and [Visual Studio Marketplace (VS2017-2019)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterPalotas.AlphaleonisProjectSetManager)
